Current status: Found bug that prevents beacons/multicast/bcast from working, it's a disabled irq timer

Setting the timer irq flag again allows flawless operation.

HOWEVER, as soon as a fifo overflow occures and the mac hw is reset and irq flags restored the issue happens again immediately.

Possible solutions:

Scrap all socketbuffers. The overflow seems to be related to mcast/bcast/beacon frames, start there

There is still state somewhere in the hardware and it's a hardware bug
